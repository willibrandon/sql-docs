# Discontinued database engine functionality in SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[sqlserver](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

  This topic describes the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] features that are no longer available in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  

## Discontinued features in [!INCLUDE[sssql22](../includes/sssql22-md.md)]  

- The following Machine Learning Services packages are no longer included with installation of SQL Server 2022. Instead, you can installed any custom packages as desired. For more information, see [What's new in SQL Server Machine Learning Services?](../machine-learning/what-s-new-in-sql-server-machine-learning-services.md)

    | **Language** | **Package** |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | Python | [microsoftml](../machine-learning/python/ref-py-microsoftml.md)| 
    | R | [olapR](../machine-learning/r/ref-r-olapr.md) | 
    | R | [sqlrutils](../machine-learning/r/ref-r-sqlrutils.md) | 
    | R | [MicrosoftML (R)](../machine-learning/r/ref-r-microsoftml.md) |

- SQL Server Big Data Clusters will be retired. See information in [[!INCLUDE[big-data-cluster](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] overview](../big-data-cluster/big-data-cluster-overview.md).

- SQL Server PolyBase scale-out groups will be retired. Scale out group functionality is removed from the product in SQL Server 2022. PolyBase data virtualization continues to be fully supported as a scale-up feature in SQL Server. See [Changes to PolyBase support in SQL Server](../big-data-cluster/big-data-options.md#changes-to-polybase-support-in-sql-server).


## Discontinued features in [!INCLUDE[sssql19](../includes/sssql19-md.md)]  

- The following database scoped configuration options are discontinued:

  - `DISABLE_BATCH_MODE_ADAPTIVE_JOIN`
  - `DISABLE_BATCH_MODE_MEMORY_GRANT_FEEDBACK`
  - `DISABLE_INTERLEAVED_EXECUTION_TVF`

For current configuration options, see [ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md).

>[!NOTE]
>No features were discontinued in [!INCLUDE[sssql14](../includes/sssql17-md.md)].

## Discontinued features in [!INCLUDE[sssql15-md](../includes/sssql16-md.md)]

- [!INCLUDE[sssql15-md](../includes/sssql16-md.md)] is a 64-bit application. 32-bit installation is discontinued, though some elements run as 32-bit components.  

- Compatibility level 90 is discontinued. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE Compatibility Level &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level.md).  

- ActiveX subsystem is discontinued. Use command line or PowerShell scripts instead.

- Startup parameters **-h** and **-g**. For more information, see [Database Engine Service Startup Options](/previous-versions/sql/2014/database-engine/configure-windows/database-engine-service-startup-options?view=sql-server-2014&preserve-view=true).

- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption is discontinued. Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) instead. For more information, see [Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine](../database-engine/configure-windows/enable-encrypted-connections-to-the-database-engine.md).

- `precompute rank` Server configuration option was discontinued beginning with SQL Server 2008. The article has been removed from documentation.
